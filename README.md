The Reduction 

The Reduction was built using MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS.  Screenshots of the sites current functionality can 
be found in the folder linked [here](https://github.com/hoosRed/theReduction/tree/master/reductionScreenshots).  Moving forward I intend to add stock market tracking functionality as well as a twitter sentiment component.
